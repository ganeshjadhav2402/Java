# Methods/Functions

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

Why are functions used?

# a. If some functionality is performed at multiple places in software, then

rather than writing the same code, again and again, we create a function

and call it everywhere. This helps reduce code redundancy.

# b. Functions make maintenance of code easy as we have to change at one

place if we make future changes to the functionality.

# c. Functions make the code more readable and easy to understand.
