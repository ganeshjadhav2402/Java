# Time & Space Complexity

# Arrays In Java
Arrays in Java are like a list of elements of the same type i.e. a list of integers, a list of
booleans etc.
            a. Creating an Array (method 1) - with new keyword
                int[] marks = new int[3];
                marks[0] = 97;
                marks[1] = 98;
                marks[2] = 95;
            b. Creating an Array (method 2)
                int[] marks = {98, 97, 95};
