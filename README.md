# Java 

# Loops
Print if a number is prime or not (Input n from the user).
[In this problem you will learn how to check if a number is prime or not]

# Patterns

# Methods/Functions
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

# Time & Space Complexity
Explain a code working Time, and code spaces layers in storage tank. Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

Types of notations
            1. O-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic upper bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by O(g(n)).                       Pronounced as “big-oh of g of n”. It is also known as worst case time complexity as it denotes the upper bound in                  which the algorithm terminates.
            2. Ω-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic lower bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by Ω(g(n)).                       Pronounced as “big-omega of g of n”. It is also known as best case time complexity as it denotes the lower
               bound in which the algorithm terminates.
            3. 𝚯-notation: It is used to denote the average time of a program.

 Comparison of functions on the basis of time complexity
    
   It follows the following order in case of time complexity:

   O(n n) > O(n!) > O(n3) > O(n2) > O(n.log(n)) > O(n.log(log(n))) > O(n) > O(sqrt(n)) > O(log(n)) > O(1)

Note: Reverse is the order for better performance of a code with corresponding time complexity, i.e. a program with less time complexity is more efficient.

Space Complexity
            Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time takenby a program to run as a function of length of the input. It is directly proportional to the largest memory your program acquires at any instance during run time.
For example: int consumes 4 bytes of memory.

# Arrays In Java
Arrays in Java are like a list of elements of the same type i.e. a list of integers, a list of
booleans etc.
            a. Creating an Array (method 1) - with new keyword
                int[] marks = new int[3];
                marks[0] = 97;
                marks[1] = 98;
                marks[2] = 95;
            b. Creating an Array (method 2)
                int[] marks = {98, 97, 95};
